## 3. Latest Result

Prepared the controlled proxy pose/motion test specification:

```text
reports/MIKAGE_CHARACTER_PROXY_POSE_MOTION_TEST_SPEC_FROM_ANCHOR_V1.md
```

Specification result: PREPARED.

The specification defines the exact `.blend` allowed for a future controlled pose/motion test, proposed future output files, allowed control groups, forbidden controls and features, pose test list, short motion test list, identity-preservation checks, frame/checkpoint review requirements, failure conditions, and rollback boundaries.

No `.blend` file was modified. No pose test was run. No motion test was run. No animation, render, or cinematic output was created. No final rig readiness is claimed. No final asset lock is claimed. No cinematic readiness is claimed. The Anchor V1 locked reference was not modified.
