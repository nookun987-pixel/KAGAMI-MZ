## 3. Latest Result

Executed the proxy rig build for review:

```text
production/character/proxy_actor/MIKAGE_PROXY_3D_ACTOR_FROM_ANCHOR_V1_RIG_PREP_BLOCKOUT.blend
```

Execution result: BUILT_FOR_REVIEW.

Created a separate review-only proxy rig output from the existing Anchor V1 proxy blockout. The source blockout `.blend` was not overwritten. The output contains one minimal proxy armature/control setup, preserves exactly two separate sensor slit objects, keeps helmet/sensor slits/sword/pauldrons rigid, keeps the sword as a right-side rectangular slab, keeps hair as a left-side mass shell, and keeps the source anchor plane reference-only.

No final rig readiness is claimed. No final asset lock is claimed. No cinematic readiness is claimed. The Anchor V1 locked reference was not modified.
